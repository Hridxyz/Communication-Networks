# Communication Networks

This repository contains a collection of programs designed to illustrate various algorithms and methods used in the field of communication networks. The implementations are primarily focused on data communication and network protocols, providing practical examples of how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Bit Stuffing:** Demonstrates the bit stuffing technique used in data framing to prevent misinterpretation of data.
- **Character Count:** Implements a character counting method for data integrity.
- **Checksum:** Provides a simple checksum algorithm for error detection in data transmission.
- **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):** Offers an implementation of the CRC method for detecting accidental changes to raw data.
- **Hamming Code:** Showcases the Hamming Code technique for error detection and correction.
- **Routing Algorithms:** Includes examples of routing algorithms used in network communications.

## Getting Started
To use these programs, clone the repository and compile the C files using a C compiler. Each program is standalone and demonstrates a specific concept in communication networks.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the existing code or add new examples related to communication networks are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit your pull requests.
